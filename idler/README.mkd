Poor man power manager. Is akin to xautolock or xss-lock, but also works in Wayland and console, since activity tracking is done via evdev. Takes battery state into consideration.

1. curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
2. Edit settings at the top of script to match your needs
3. Run this script. Use `-d` command line argument to run it in background

Poor man power manager. Is akin to xautolock or xss-lock, but also works in Wayland and console, since activity tracking is done via evdev. Takes battery state into consideration.

1. curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
2. Edit settings at the top of script to match your needs
3. Run this script. Use `-f` command line argument to debug
4. `kill -STOP` and `kill -CONT` to pause/resume script

A simple all-in-one alternative to nvidia-xrun, optirun, primusrun... Bumblebee is complex, slow and has no Vulkan support. Nvidia-xrun doesn't handle some critical issues and also needs to be run from another console.

This solution will be dropped once Nvidia will add render offload device support.

1. Install Nvidia drivers for your distro (kernel modules)
2. Optionally install bbswitch if you need power management (kernel module)
2. curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
3. Edit settings at the top of script to match your needs
4. Run this script as `primerun.sh <your game>`
